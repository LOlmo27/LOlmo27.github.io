                <h2>About Me (❛◡˂̵ ̑̑✧)</h2>
                <p>My name is Leni and I enjoy reading, gaming, and long walks outside. 
                    I love to spend time with my sister and friends. I am a hardworker, 
                    but I still enjoy myself. I take pride in what I do and enjoy, and my interests 
                    are very diverse. From music to games to books! I try to always see the positive, and I love to explore new things! 
                    I've wanted to always make a safe space like this to post my work, even if only a few people will see it, I'm glad they did! 
                    If those few people continue to view my work, I hope they enjoy the effort I put into it. I try to always provide fun and joy to all!
                    So if you like exploring the unknown, and enjoy the simpler side of life, well you've found the right place and person to do just that!</p>

                <h2>About Bistros's Lounge ❀ܓ(｡◠ ꇴ ◠｡ )</h2>
                <p>Depsite the name, this lounge is no more than what you want (No, it is not an actual bistro...no sweets sadly). 
                    Bistro's Lounge is a safe spot to post my work and games, and for others to have nice time looking at simple things. 
                     I have always wanted to create a place like this, so if you happen to stumble across this little website, please share
                     it around! I hope that this will become big, and that it'll bring happiness and fun to others everywhere!
                     Although a bistro is a bakery, and so is a lounge (we don't have a location like that...not yet anyway...) but why not roll them all together, only online!
                     So relax, cozy up with a snack, and whether you're on the road, on the seas, or in the skies, I hope you enjoy your stay here at Bistro's Lounge! And, once again, snacks are not provided.
